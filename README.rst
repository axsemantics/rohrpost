====================================

`rohrpost` is a simple WebSocket protocol that works well with Django_ using
Channels_. It will interface with every service implementing the ASGI_
specification (which, at the moment, is primarily Channels_ with Daphne_).

The client implementation is rohrpost-js_.

Capabilities
------------

`rohrpost` specifies a very simple protocol with messages looking like this:

.. code:: JSON

    {
        "id": 123,
        "type": "ping",
        "data": "something",
    }

This message will be handled by the ping handler (which rohrpost provides out
of the box). You can add custom handlers using a method decorator. Please see
`our documentation`_ for details on the protocol and handler implementation.

`rohrpost` also provides a mixin for Django_ models to push notifications on
changes (create, update, delete).

Installation
------------

From the command line::

    pip install rohrpost

Or add this line to your `requirements.txt`::

    rohrpost==2.x

Development
-----------

For development you'll need to have the test environment installed. This is
rather large since `rohrpost` works mainly in conjunction with Channels_,
Daphne_, Django_ and so on. ::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Run tests and style checks in this directory::

    py.test
    pylava
    isort -rc .
