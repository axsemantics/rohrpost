rohrpost â€“ a protocol for Django Channels
=========================================

Welcome to the rohrpost documentation!

rohrpost is a small library that aims to make protocol development for
`Django's`_ sub-project channels_ (which provides WebSockets capabilities) easy
and fun. We also have a client library called `rohrpost.js`_.

It features a light weight, JSON based protocol, including an exemplary handler
implementing a ping/pong method. It also comes with a variety of helper
functions, and Django model mixins that allow to automatically send updates when
any user updates, deletes, or creates an object.

Protocol
--------

The rohrpost protocol sits on top of channels_ inside the ``text`` component of
a channels message. rohrpost expects this ``text`` component to be valid JSON
with

- An ``id`` field that rohrpost sends back in the response.
- A ``type`` field that contains a string defining the message type (and hence,
  which handler will process the message).
- An optional ``data`` field containing whatever data rohrpost should pass to
  the handler. Please note that rohrpost will pass all request data to the
  handler, and the naming of the ``data`` field is convention, not a rule.

A typical message would look like this:

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
       "id": 1234,
       "type": "ping",
       "data": [1, 2, 3, 4]
   }

Both server and client messages look like this. When the server receives a
message, it will hand off the message to the appropriate handler named in the
``type`` field. If there is no such handler or the handler fails, the server
responds with a message containing at least an ``error`` field, and optionally
other data in the ``data`` field.

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
       "id": 1234,
       "error": "No registered handler called 'ping'."
   }

Installation
------------

From the command line::

    pip install rohrpost

Or add this line to your `requirements.txt`::

    rohrpost==1.x


Routing
-------

Once you have installed `rohrpost`, you'll need to add the main `rohrpost`
handler to your `routing.py`. You can find details on this in Channels'
`routing documentation`_.

.. code:: Python

    from channels import route
    from rohrpost.main import handle_rohrpost_message

    channel_routing = [
        route('websocket.receive', handle_rohrpost_message, path=r'/rohrpost/$'),
    ]


Adding Handlers
---------------

rohrpost provides a decorator ``rohrpost_handler``, that accepts both a string
and a list to register a method as the handler for incoming messages. This is
how the ping method works, that rohrpost provides out of the box:

.. code-block:: python

   from rohrpost.message import send_message
   from rohrpost.registry import rohrpost_handler


   @rohrpost_handler('ping')
   def handle_ping(message, request):
    response_kwargs = {
        'message': message,
        'message_id': request['id'],
        'handler': 'pong'
    }
    if 'data' in request:
        response_kwargs['data'] = request['data']
    send_message(**response_kwargs)

Using the mixins
----------------

We have four relevant Django model mixins in ``rohrpost.mixins``:
``NotifyOnCreate``, ``NotifyOnUpdate``, ``NotifyOnDelete`` and
``NotifyOnChange`` which inherits from the previous three classes.

When using these mixins, you'll need to set some fields or fill in some methods:

- ``get_group_name(self, message_type)`` or ``group_name``, with the method
  having preference over the attribute. This method or attribute should return a
  string that denotes the group receiving the message. All users in that group
  will receive a message. This gives you the possibility to build per-object,
  per-class or global groups.
  If neither the message nor the attribute are present, the group name is the
  lower cased class name combined with the object's ID:
  f'{object.__class__.__name__.lower()}-{object.pk}'
- ``get_push_notification_data(self, updated_fields, message_type)`` returning a
  dictionary (or any data structure) containing the data you wish to send to the
  client.
  rohrpost will update the serialized object updated with an ``updated_fields``
  attribute with a list *if* you do not set ``updated_fields`` in
  ``get_push_notification_data()`` *and* if you set it when calling the
  ``save()`` method that lead to the notification.
  The fallback value if you do not fill in this method is ``{"id": obj.id}``.

The message will look like this::

    {
        "id": <some id>,
        "type": "subscription-update",
        "data": {
            "type": <create|update|delete>,
            "group": <group-name>,
            "object": <serialized object>,
        }
    }

You will have to put users who should receive these notifications in the group
specified by ``get_group_name`` or ``group_name``. Since authentication and
registration works differently in every use case, rohrpost does not include a
standard handler for this.


Utility functions
-----------------

rohrpost provides three main helper functions for message sending in
``rohrpost.message``:

- ``rohrpost.message.send_message``

  - ``message``: The original message you are replying to (**required**).
  - ``handler``: The string identifying your handler (**required**).
  - ``message_id``: The message ID (any simple datatype allowed). If you do not
    provide any, an integer will be randomly chosen.
  - ``close``: Set to ``True`` if you want to close the connection.
  - ``error``: Include an error message or error content
  - ``data``: A dict that will appear in the message as ``data`` (converted to
    a JSON object).
  - ``**additional_data``: Any other keyword argument will appear in the
    message's ``data`` field as a JSON object.  This is deprecated.

- ``rohrpost.message.send_error`` sends an error message explicitly, takes the
  same arguments as ``send_message``.
